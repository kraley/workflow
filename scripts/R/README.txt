This README file provides instructions on how to run the code in this repository.

You will need to edit the setup_example.R file to set global macros to directories on 
your commputer. Save the script as setup_<yourusername>. <yourusername> is your username on this computer.

Change to the workflow/scripts/R directory before starting stata or within stata.

run marcoh_trends.R

After the scripts run, you should find the results (Table1R.xlsx) in the directory assigned in the  results object created in the setup_<username>. Unfortunately,
I am not skilled enough in R yet to be able to make the table look how I would like.
